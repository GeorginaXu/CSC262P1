# CSC262P1
Smith College / CSC262 Operating Systems / Cooperative Multitasking Shell in Java

## Learning Goals

Learn a little bit about how the UNIX shell works from an inside perspective, while looking at a form of scheduling that is not based on interrupts and timeslices.

## Implement Some UNIX Tools

- Echo: print the arguments to the output.
- ListFiles: print all the files in the current directory.
- SimpleGrep: find lines with an argument string on them.
- RegexGrep: find lines with a java.util.Regex argument string on them.
- Sort: sort lines that are observed and print them in order.
- Head: display only the first $arg lines
- Tail: display only the last $arg lines

## A "more-real" Shell

Stretch: use ProcessBuilder to allow calls to external programs.
